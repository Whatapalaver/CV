---------

An energetic and values-driven full stack developer at The Victoria and Albert Museum currently working on a complete rebuild of the museum's Explore the Collection website. This was my first coding role since graduating from Makers, a developer bootcamp in London.

I am passionate about data and the ability to delve into databases to reveal stories about peoples lives (NHS) or culturally significant objects (V&A). I enjoy continuous learning and development and love the challenges that are an everyday part of a coding career.

I am also a qualified CIMA accountant and have previously held a number of Senior Finance roles within the NHS. I have extensive experience in technical healthcare roles, covering areas such as acute finance commissioning, income reporting, PbR, reference costing, SLR, patient level costing and financial planning. All my previous roles have had a strong technical slant and I have developed strong skills in VBA and tSQL.

I have multiple interests such as ice-swimming and powerlifting that occupy me in my spare time.

**Tech Skills :** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Javascript, Node.js, tSQL, Elasticsearch, Docker, AWS, MS Excel, VBA

## Skills

### Analytical and Judgement Skills

A concise, logical thinker with an ability to exploit technical skills to solve problems rapidly and clearly. My joy of solving problems has been well tested in my new coding career where I've faced implementation and logic problems on a daily basis, my prior experience has helped me remain calm and apply a logical, scientific approach to resolving the current issue. It is this rollercoaster of frustration and reward that makes coding so appealing for me.

### Technical Skills

- Ruby and Ruby on Rails which is the framework for the V&A CMS.
- Python which is the scripting language behind Search the Collections website at the V&A. I am using python to build an elasticsearch API and a number of data importers for our extensive data pipeline.
- Elasticsearch and search relevance
- JavaScript, Node and React
- IIIF (International image interoperability framework) 
- Advanced Excel and SQL data skills with a proven ability to transform vast, complex data into meaningful management reports.
- tSQL / MS Query / SSIS - writing queries and procedures to automate processes. Large scale project examples include, NHS NWL Whole Systems a multi organisation patient costing project.

### Communication

Ability to impart technical information clearly, to a range of specialists and senior managers. Honest approach resulting in trusted relationships with senior colleagues. Run regular lunch and learn sessions at work to encourage debate and knowledge share. I host a number of [technical blogs](#technical-blogging) where I write tutorials on key analytical skills. If I had a mission statement it would probably be `Learn cool things and share`.

### Management

Provide strong, value driven leadership. Brought the NCL Acute Finance team through three major reorganisations and ensured continuity and quality of departmental output. I have a strong reputation for being delivery-focussed and efficient.

### Continuous Development

Improvement focused - value continuous development both individually and departmentally. I love a challenge and am becoming ever more comfortable with feeling very uncomfortable!
